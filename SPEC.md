# GAME DESIGN SPECIFICATION: GREENLIGHT

**A Stardew Valley-Style Simulation Game Set in a Streaming Giant's Amsterdam Office**

Version 1.0 — February 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Greenlight is a single-player simulation game inspired by the relaxing, relationship-driven structure of Stardew Valley, set within the Amsterdam headquarters of a major global streaming service. Players step into the role of Steve, a newly arrived content executive whose job is to read incoming scripts, develop meaningful creative relationships with filmmakers, and shepherd projects through the volatile pipeline from first draft to global premiere.

Where Stardew Valley asks you to tend crops and nurture a small town, Greenlight asks you to tend creative projects and nurture the people who make them. The daily rhythm of reading scripts, scheduling meetings, and giving notes replaces watering plants and feeding animals, while the deeper systems of relationship-building, seasonal events, and long-term consequences remain firmly intact.

The game targets a broad audience of creative industry professionals, cinephiles, and fans of cozy simulation games who want something with more narrative bite than the typical farming sim.

## 2. Concept & Design Pillars

### 2.1 The Elevator Pitch

You are Steve, a content executive at a streaming giant's Amsterdam office. Every day, scripts land on your desk. Every script represents someone's dream. Your job is to figure out which dreams are worth chasing, help shape them into something great, and navigate the politics, personalities, and pressures of a global entertainment company—all while trying to build a life for yourself in one of Europe's most beautiful cities.

### 2.2 Design Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|---|---|
| **Creative Cultivation** | Scripts are your crops. Reading, giving notes, and developing projects over multiple drafts is the core loop. You plant seeds of ideas and watch them grow (or wither). |
| **Meaningful Relationships** | Filmmakers, writers, directors, and fellow executives are your townsfolk. Each has a unique personality, creative philosophy, and relationship arc. Your notes and choices shape how they see you. |
| **Cozy Consequences** | Decisions matter but never punish. A cancelled show isn't game over—it's a story beat. A filmmaker who leaves angry might return seasons later with a masterpiece. The tone stays warm even when the stakes are real. |
| **Amsterdam as Character** | The city isn't just a backdrop. Canal-side walks, brown café conversations, cycling through rain, and seasonal Dutch festivals all feed into gameplay and relationship-building. |
| **Industry Authenticity** | The game treats the creative process with genuine respect. Notes aren't arbitrary—they have real impact on script quality. The pipeline from pitch to premiere mirrors real production realities. |

## 3. Setting & World

### 3.1 The Office

The primary hub is the Amsterdam office, a converted canal-side warehouse reimagined as a modern creative workspace. The building has four floors, each unlocked progressively as Steve's career advances.

| Floor | Area | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Ground | The Lobby & Café | Social hub, casual filmmaker meetings, overhear gossip that hints at upcoming scripts and office politics |
| First | Content Bullpen | Steve's desk, script inbox, colleague desks. Where the daily grind happens. |
| Second | Executive Suites | Meeting rooms for pitches and notes sessions. Unlocked after first promotion. |
| Third | The Screening Room | Private screenings of completed projects. Unlocked in Year 2. Where you see the results of your work. |
| Rooftop | The Terrace | Prestigious social space. End-of-season parties, visiting talent meet-and-greets. Unlocked in Year 3. |

### 3.2 Amsterdam

Beyond the office, Steve can explore a curated map of Amsterdam neighborhoods, each with distinct flavour and gameplay purpose. Locations are rendered in a warm, slightly stylized pixel-art aesthetic inspired by Stardew Valley but with an urban European sensibility.

| Location | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Jordaan Canals | Walking routes for one-on-one conversations with filmmakers. Relationship-building scenes trigger here. |
| Vondelpark | Weekend relaxation spot. Restores Steve's creative energy. Seasonal events held here. |
| De Pijp Market | Buy gifts for filmmakers and colleagues. Each character has preferred gifts that boost relationships. |
| Leidseplein Cinemas | Watch competitors' releases. Provides insight into market trends and audience preferences. |
| Brown Cafés | Multiple venues for after-work drinks. Different cafés attract different filmmaker archetypes. |
| Steve's Apartment | Houseboat on the Prinsengracht. Customisable interior. Rest here to end the day. |

### 3.3 Seasons & Time

The game follows a calendar system with four seasons per year, each lasting 28 in-game days. Each day runs from 8:00 AM to midnight. Steve has a finite amount of energy each day, spent on reading scripts, attending meetings, exploring the city, and socialising. Going to bed restores energy. Seasons correspond to the natural rhythms of the entertainment industry: development pushes in spring, festival season in autumn, awards campaigning in winter, and summer hiatus for personal projects and travel.

## 4. Core Gameplay Loop

### 4.1 The Daily Rhythm

Each in-game day follows a flexible but structured rhythm that mirrors a real content executive's working life. Mornings are for desk work: checking the script inbox, reading coverage reports, and responding to emails. Afternoons shift to meetings: pitch sessions with new filmmakers, notes sessions on active projects, or internal strategy meetings with colleagues. Evenings are Steve's own time to explore Amsterdam, build relationships over dinner or drinks, attend screenings, or simply rest.

The player is never forced into a rigid schedule. Like Stardew Valley, you choose how to spend each day's energy. Skip the scripts and spend all day at the park if you want—but your inbox will pile up, and filmmakers waiting for notes will grow impatient.

### 4.2 Script Reading & Notes

This is the beating heart of the game. Scripts arrive in Steve's inbox and must be read, evaluated, and given notes.

**Reading:** When Steve opens a script, the player sees a stylised summary: the title, genre, logline, a brief excerpt of key scenes, and a set of creative attributes displayed as visual meters (e.g., Character Depth, Plot Coherence, Dialogue Quality, Originality, Commercial Viability). Reading a full script costs a significant chunk of energy. Steve can also skim scripts for a quick read at lower energy cost, but this reveals fewer attributes and makes notes less effective.

**Giving Notes:** After reading, the player enters a notes interface where they choose from categories of feedback. Notes are not arbitrary—each maps to a specific script attribute and has a tone dimension. For example, you might choose to address weak dialogue by suggesting the writer lean into subtext (gentle, craft-focused note) or by flagging that the dialogue feels on-the-nose and needs a complete pass (direct, challenging note). The same feedback category can be delivered in different tones, and both the content and tone affect the outcome.

**The Notes Triangle:** Every notes session navigates a three-way tension between Creative Quality (how good the script actually is), Filmmaker Relationship (how the creator feels about working with you), and Commercial Viability (whether the project will perform). Pushing hard on quality notes might strain a relationship. Being too gentle might greenlight a mediocre project. Prioritising commercial appeal might compromise artistic integrity. There is no single correct approach—different strategies yield different kinds of success.

### 4.3 The Development Pipeline

Each project moves through a multi-stage pipeline that unfolds over weeks or months of in-game time:

| Stage | Details |
|---|---|
| Submission | Script arrives in inbox. Player decides whether to read or pass. |
| Coverage | After reading, player writes an internal recommendation: Pass, Consider, or Recommend. |
| Development | If greenlit, the project enters active development. Multiple rounds of notes over several in-game weeks. The script evolves based on player feedback. |
| Packaging | Attach a director and lead cast. Player can influence these choices through relationships. |
| Production | The project enters production. Random events (budget issues, casting changes, location problems) require executive decisions. |
| Post-Production | Rough cuts arrive for feedback. Final notes opportunity before release. |
| Release & Reception | The project launches. Critical and audience reception is influenced by all prior decisions. Awards potential is calculated. |

## 5. Characters & Relationships

### 5.1 Relationship System

Every NPC has a relationship meter with ten hearts, exactly like Stardew Valley. Hearts are earned through daily interactions, thoughtful gifts, attending their events, and most importantly, through the quality and tone of your creative collaboration. A filmmaker whose vision you championed when nobody else believed in it will remember. So will one whose script you buried with harsh notes in a public meeting.

At key heart thresholds (2, 5, 8, 10), unique cutscene events unlock that deepen the character's backstory and open new gameplay opportunities. A director at 8 hearts might offer Steve an executive producer credit on their passion project. A rival executive at 5 hearts might become an unexpected ally.

### 5.2 Character Archetypes

The game features approximately 30 named NPCs across several categories:

**Filmmakers:** The auteur who refuses all notes and makes brilliant things if you trust them. The eager newcomer who needs guidance but has raw talent. The veteran who's lost their spark and needs the right project to reignite it. The commercial hitmaker who secretly wants to make art. The festival darling who can't connect with mainstream audiences. Each filmmaker has a creative philosophy that determines how they respond to different types of notes.

**Office Colleagues:** Steve's boss, a seasoned VP who's seen it all and values bold bets. The data analyst who quantifies everything and distrusts gut instinct. The office manager who knows everyone's secrets and runs the place from behind the scenes.

**Industry Contacts:** Agents who push their clients' scripts. Festival programmers who can make or break a film's reputation. Critics whose early reviews shift industry conversation. Competing executives from other streamers who occasionally poach talent or try to poach Steve.

### 5.3 Romance

In keeping with the Stardew tradition, Steve can pursue romantic relationships with a subset of eligible NPCs. These are handled with the same warmth and low-pressure approach: the player initiates by reaching high heart levels and giving a specific rare gift. Romance adds personal stakes to professional decisions—dating a filmmaker whose project you might need to cancel creates genuinely compelling tension.

## 6. Progression & Economy

### 6.1 Career Progression

Steve begins as a junior content executive and advances through a career ladder over the course of the game. Promotions are earned through a combination of project success, relationship quality, and strategic reputation. Each tier unlocks new gameplay systems, office areas, and narrative opportunities.

| Title | Unlocks | Timeframe |
|---|---|---|
| Junior Executive | Script inbox, basic notes tools, ground floor access | Year 1: Spring–Summer |
| Content Executive | Development meetings, filmmaker relationships deepen, 2nd floor | Year 1: Autumn–Winter |
| Senior Executive | Packaging decisions (director/cast), screening room, festival travel | Year 2 |
| Director of Content | Slate strategy, mentoring junior execs, rooftop access | Year 3 |
| VP of Content | Full creative control, legacy projects, endgame narrative | Year 4+ |

### 6.2 Reputation Systems

Steve builds three distinct reputations that act as soft currencies throughout the game:

- **Creative Reputation** reflects how the artistic community perceives Steve—auteurs and festival programmers care about this.
- **Commercial Reputation** tracks Steve's track record of hits and audience numbers—the data team and marketing love this.
- **Industry Reputation** is the broader perception of Steve as a player in the entertainment world—agents, competing executives, and the press watch this one.

These three reputations don't always move in the same direction. Greenlighting a challenging arthouse film might boost creative reputation while risking commercial standing. The player must decide what kind of executive Steve becomes.

### 6.3 Economy

The in-game economy revolves around Steve's personal salary (spent on apartment upgrades, gifts, and city activities) and a departmental budget that constrains how many projects can be in active development simultaneously. Budget is refreshed each quarter. Overperforming projects generate bonus budget for the next cycle. Underperforming ones reduce it. Steve's personal spending money increases with promotions and bonuses tied to project success.

## 7. Key Systems Deep Dive

### 7.1 The Script Quality Engine

Every script in the game is procedurally assembled from a library of modular components: premise templates, character archetypes, plot structures, dialogue styles, and thematic cores. Each component has hidden quality values that combine into the script's overall attributes. This means no two playthroughs feature the exact same slate of scripts, and the player's notes genuinely interact with the underlying quality model rather than triggering canned outcomes.

When a player gives notes, the system evaluates the note type against the script's weak attributes. A well-targeted note on a genuine weakness improves the script. A note that misidentifies a strength as a weakness can make things worse. This rewards attentive reading and developing an eye for what actually needs work.

### 7.2 The Festival Circuit

Starting in Year 2, Steve can submit completed projects to fictional equivalents of major film festivals: the Venice-like autumn prestige showcase, the Sundance-style winter indie discovery event, the Cannes-equivalent summer spectacle, and the Berlin-inspired political cinema gathering. Each festival has different selection criteria and jury tastes. Successfully navigating the festival circuit unlocks awards season gameplay, where Steve campaigns for recognition while managing the expectations of filmmakers who are emotionally invested in winning.

### 7.3 The Houseboat

Steve's houseboat apartment on the Prinsengracht serves as the Stardew farmhouse equivalent. It starts small and spartan, and the player can gradually upgrade and decorate it. Furniture, art, and personal items can be purchased at De Pijp Market or received as gifts from NPCs. Certain decorations provide passive gameplay bonuses: a good bookshelf increases reading speed, art from a filmmaker friend improves relationship maintenance, a high-end coffee machine boosts morning energy.

### 7.4 Random Events & Crises

The game regularly introduces unpredictable events that disrupt routine and demand creative problem-solving: a lead actor drops out mid-production; a script leaks online and causes a PR crisis; a filmmaker has a creative breakthrough that requires budget reallocation; a competing streamer announces a suspiciously similar project; a Dutch cycling strike makes getting to the office an adventure. These events keep the simulation from becoming rote and create emergent storytelling moments.

## 8. Aesthetic & Tone

### 8.1 Visual Style

The game uses a top-down pixel art style directly descended from Stardew Valley, but with a distinctly European urban palette. Warm oranges and deep blues dominate the Amsterdam exteriors, evoking the city's famous golden-age lighting. Interiors are modern and design-forward, reflecting the tech-company aesthetic of the office contrasted with the cosy, cluttered warmth of brown cafés and Steve's houseboat. Characters are expressive 32x32 sprites with portrait art for dialogue scenes.

### 8.2 Audio

The soundtrack blends lo-fi ambient electronica for office scenes, warm acoustic guitar for Amsterdam exploration, and cinematic orchestral swells for script-reading montages and premiere sequences. Sound design emphasises the tactile pleasure of the daily routine: the click of a bicycle lock, the rustle of script pages, the clink of glasses in a café, rain on canal water.

### 8.3 Writing & Tone

The writing is warm, witty, and literate. Characters speak like real people in the film industry—passionate, occasionally pretentious, sometimes insecure, always interesting. The game treats the creative process with respect and genuine curiosity. It's satirical without being cynical. The humour comes from recognition, not mockery. A filmmaker passionately defending their 4-hour cut should feel funny and endearing, not pathetic.

## 10. Appendix: Sample Day

The following illustrates a typical mid-game day in the life of Steve to convey the intended player experience:

**8:00 AM** — Steve wakes up on his houseboat. Rain on the windows. He makes coffee (high-end machine: +1 energy bonus). Checks his phone: two new scripts in the inbox, an email from a filmmaker asking when notes will be ready, and a calendar reminder about a pitch meeting at 2 PM.

**9:00 AM** — Arrives at the office by bike. Quick chat with colleagues in the lobby café. The office manager mentions that the VP is in a bad mood after a project underperformed. Useful intel.

**10:00 AM** — Sits at desk. Opens the first script: a Dutch-language thriller with a strong premise but clunky dialogue. Full read costs 3 energy. The player studies the quality meters and decides to focus notes on dialogue and pacing. They choose a supportive tone—this writer is talented but fragile (2 hearts).

**12:00 PM** — Lunch break in the café. A filmmaker Steve has been developing a project with sits down. She's nervous about the upcoming rough cut screening. The player chooses reassuring dialogue options. Relationship +0.5 hearts.

**2:00 PM** — Pitch meeting. A new director presents a sci-fi limited series concept. The premise is wildly original but the budget would be enormous. The player must decide: champion the risky project (creative reputation +, budget risk +), suggest scaling down (practical but might lose the director's trust), or pass entirely.

**4:00 PM** — Unexpected event: the lead actor on an active production has posted something controversial on social media. PR crisis meeting. The player navigates a tense conversation with marketing and legal, trying to protect both the project and the filmmaker.

**6:00 PM** — Evening free time. Steve cycles to a brown café in the Jordaan where a filmmaker he's been trying to build a relationship with hangs out. They bond over shared taste in cinema. Relationship +1 heart. The filmmaker hints at a new project they're developing.

**9:00 PM** — Back at the houseboat. Steve skim-reads the second script from this morning before bed (1 energy). It's a romantic comedy with commercial potential but no soul. Note for tomorrow: figure out if the writer can find the heart of it, or pass.

**10:30 PM** — Sleep. Day saved. Tomorrow: notes session on the thriller, a decision on the sci-fi pitch, and it's almost King's Day—the whole office is planning something.
